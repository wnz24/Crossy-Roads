Welcome!

Our models are now preconfigured for Universal Render Pipeline (URP) by default. This means that upon opening the project, everything is already set up and ready to use with URP.
However, we also provide tools to convert the project to Built-In (SRP) or HDRP, depending on your needs.

Inside the folder Render_Pipeline_Convert, you will find three Unity packages:
- Unity_6_Built-In_source.unitypackage
- Unity_6_URP_source.unitypackage
- Unity_6_HDRP_source.unitypackage

These packages automatically convert all shaders and materials in the project to the corresponding Render Pipeline.

1. Switching to Built-In Render Pipeline
If you want to switch the project from URP to Built-In:
- Open your project in Unity.
- Navigate to the Assets/Render_Pipeline_Convert folder.
- Double-click on Unity_6_Built-In_source.unitypackage.
- Click Import to apply the conversion.
This package will replace URP shaders with Built-In versions for all materials and set the appropriate project settings.

2. Switching to HDRP
If you prefer to use the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP):
- Open your project in Unity.
- Go to Assets/Render_Pipeline_Convert.
- Double-click on Unity_6_HDRP_source.unitypackage.
- Click Import to begin the conversion.
This package updates your materials and shaders to HDRP-compatible versions and configures the project accordingly.

3. Reverting to URP (if needed)
If at any time you want to return to URP:
- Open the project in Unity.
- Go to Assets/Render_Pipeline_Convert.
- Double-click on Unity_6_URP_source.unitypackage.
- Click Import.
This will revert all materials and render settings back to URP.

Additional Manual Options (if you prefer to do it yourself)

Installing URP manually:
- Open Unity.
- Go to Window > Package Manager.
- In the Unity Registry, install Universal RP.
- Use Window > Rendering > Render Pipeline Converter to upgrade materials and settings from Built-In to URP.

Installing HDRP manually:
- Open Unity.
- Go to Window > Package Manager.
- Install High Definition RP.
- Use Window > Rendering > HDRP Wizard, scroll to "Convert All Built-In Materials to HDRP" and click Proceed (make sure to back up your project first).

Conclusion
We hope this setup allows you to work comfortably in the render pipeline that best fits your project.
